# AndroidRESTRequester
Android-Library, which combines [Volley](https://github.com/google/volley) and [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) for making simple JSON-Requests consuming REST-APIs

# Goals
This library has the goal to simplify the process of consuming  a REST-API based on JSON as the format of the provided data. 

## Current Features

- JSONRequest with Volley for the basic CRUD-HTTP-Verbs(GET, PUT, POST, DELETE) 
- Serialization and Deserialization of instances of custom made classes send and received by a REST-API with Gson

## Upcoming Features

- Making use of Volley-Caching
- Extending the supported range of HTTP-Verbs(PATCH, HEAD etc.)
- Adding headers to a request
- Appropriate Error Handling (Error Messages, Exceptions etc.)
